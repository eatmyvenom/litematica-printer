# Litematica-Printer

## Setup

To set this up just add the latest litematica version to your mods folder as well as this, it will replace easy place with printer. This does not use accurate placement protocol and therefore means that in order to place blocks in some rotations, you need to rotate your player. If I stop lazy, I will add one that does use accurate placement.

## Install guide

Install fabric, litematica, malilib, as well as this mod and put this in the mods folder.

## Caution

Some servers can have an anti cheat plugin installed, this prevents 'not-looking' placement, which means you can only place the block you're looking at. Test or ask if their is one, to prevent being kicked/banned from the server.

## Settings

### Printer settings:

`easyPlaceModeRange (x,y,z)`:&emsp;	"X,Y,Z Range for EasyPlace"<br/>
`easyPlaceModeMaxBlocks`:&emsp;		"Max block interactions per cycle"<br/>
`easyPlaceModeBreakBlocks`:&emsp;	"Automatically breaks blocks."<br/>
`easyPlaceModeDelay`:&emsp;			"Delay between printing blocks.Do not set to 0 if you are playing on a server."
`easyPlaceModePaper`:&emsp;			"Enable this feature to bypass the built-in papers anti-cheat. This will make the range stricter, delay lower and only pick blocks from the hotbar."<br/>
`easyPlaceModeFluids`:&emsp;		"Enable this feature for placing fluid(water/lava) sources or waterlogged blocks. Be aware, this functions uses \"Fake rotations\", this can be seen as hacking!"<br/>
`easyPlaceModeReplaceFluids`:&emsp;	"To enable, type the name of the block which should be placed to remove excessive fluid sources."<br/>
`easyPlaceModeAccurateBlockPlacement`:&emsp;	"Places blocks immediately in the correct state (e.g. repeaters with correct delay). Requirs the accurateBlockPlacement feature from the carpet extra/quickcarpet mod!"<br/>


### Handy litematica settings:

`easyPlaceMode`:&emsp;				"When enabled, then simply trying to use an item/place a block on schematic blocks will place that block in that position."<br/>
`easyPlaceModeHoldEnabled`:&emsp;	"When enabled, then simply holding down the use key and looking at different schematic blocks will place them"<br/>
`easyPlaceClickAdjacent`:&emsp;		"If enabled, then the Easy Place mode will try to click on existing adjacent blocks. This may help on Spigot or similar servers, which don't allow clicking on air blocks."<br/>
`pickBlockAuto`:&emsp;				"Automatically pick block before every placed block"<br/>
`pickBlockEnabled`:&emsp;			"Enables the schematic world pick block hotkeys. There is also a hotkey for toggling this option to toggle those hotkeys... o.o", "Pick Block Hotkeys"<br/>
`pickBlockShulkers`:&emsp;			"If enabled, then if the required item for the pick block is not found directly in the player's inventory, but there is a Shulker box that contains it, the Shulker Box will be switched to the player's hand instead"<br/>
`pickBlockIgnoreNBT`:&emsp;			"Ignores the NBT data on the expected vs. found items for pick block. Allows the pick block to work for example with renamed items."<br/>
`pickBlockableSlots`:&emsp;			"The hotbar slots that are allowed to be used for the schematic pick block. Can use comma separated individual slots and dash separated slot ranges (no spaces anywhere). Example: 2,4-6,9"<br/>
`placementInfrontOfPlayer`:&emsp;	"When enabled, created placements or moved placements are positioned so that they are fully infront of the player, instead of the placement's origin point being at the player's location"<br/>
`renderMaterialListInGuis`:&emsp;	"Whether or not the material list should be rendered inside GUIs"<br/>
`signTextPaste`:&emsp;				"Automatically set the text in the sign GUIs from the schematic"<br/>

<br/>

`easyPlaceActivation`:&emsp;		"When the easyPlaceMode is enabled, this key must be held to enable placing the blocks when using the vanilla Use key"<br/>
`easyPlaceToggle`:&emsp;			"Allows quickly toggling on/off the Easy Place mode"<br/>
